This is a LOVE2D game designed for the Gaming Frontier Challenge (Game Development Track) in Shaastra 2022 hosted by IIT Madras.

Here is our game: Connect 4!
The Ultimate Upright Checker Dropping Challenge !

Instructions:
1) Two players will take alternate turns dropping discs, and only one disc can be dropped in each turn.
2)The game ends when all tiles are filled or if a player has 4 consecutive discs horizontally, vertically or diagonally, Like traditional X & O but much better :)

Have Fun ðŸ¥³!!
